        'Coach Brooklyn told us that she always hits her weight lifting PRs during a workout. I quickly dismissed that by saying, "That\'s not happening today". I had to eat my words. Hitting a PR is always nice. Still not super pleased with my form but much better than where I started. Still dealing with a little tightness/discomfort in the lower left part of my back but back is getting stronger.',
